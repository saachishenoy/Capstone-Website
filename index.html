                <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                <p>Our project, 'Enhancing Historical Understanding with Retrieval-Augmented Generation,' is at the forefront of blending historical inquiry with cutting-edge technology. By harnessing the power of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) coupled with Large Language Models (LLMs), we're setting a new standard for accessing historical data. Our initiative not only aims to revolutionize how historical information is accessed and interpreted
                     but also seeks to bridge the gap between vast archives of historical texts and the modern user's need for accurate, digestible information. This project represents a step towards an immersive experience, facilitated by technology that understands the nuances and complexities of historical narratives.</p>

                <h2>Technology and Development</h2>
                <p>We utilize a cutting-edge mix of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Large Language Models (LLMs), and efficient data storage solutions. This innovative tech stack allows for precise, fact-checked historical data retrieval from a vast database of twentieth-century newspapers. Our R&D process involved extensive data curation, algorithm optimization, and real-world testing. Breakthroughs include a novel method for cleaning historical data and integrating it with LLMs to provide contextually accurate information.</p>

                <h2>FAQs</h2>
                <p> <strong>How does this project improve access to historical information?</strong>
                    <br><br>
                    By combining Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with Large Language Models (LLMs), our project enhances the accuracy and depth of information retrieved from historical sources, making it easier and more reliable for users to access historical data.

                    <strong>Can anyone use this project's platform for research or educational purposes?</strong>
                    <br><br>
                    Due to copyright restrictions, the platform's data is limited to educators and students within the University of California, San Diego. Therefore, a UCSD.edu login is necessary to access the tool. This ensures compliance with copyright laws while providing valuable resources for educational and research purposes within the University of California, San Diego community.

                    <strong>What types of historical data does the project cover?</strong>
                    <br><br>
                    The project focuses on historical articles published between 1925 and 1966, specifically utilizing reputable newspapers such as the Chicago Tribune, Los Angeles Times, New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Washington Post, and San Francisco Chronicle. This selection aims to encompass a wide range of American perspectives and voices from different regions. Only articles have been included in the dataset, with items like obituaries and advertisements excluded, to optimize space and ensure relevance to the project's goals.

                    <br><br>
                    <strong>Are there any limitations to the types of questions the platform can answer?</strong>
                    <br><br>
                    While our platform covers a broad range of historical topics, it's optimized for questions related to the twentieth century. Questions outside this scope or those requiring highly specialized knowledge may be beyond our current capabilities.
